# Wilford Woodruff Stories
Wilford Woodruff Sr. (1807â€“1898) was an American religious leader and the fourth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1889 until his death. He played a significant role in the LDS Church by ending the practice of plural marriage in 1890. Woodruff joined the church as a young adult and became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He served missions in England, supported local members, and was involved in the social and economic life of the Utah community. Woodruff became president of the St. George Temple and contributed to the standardization of temple ceremonies. In 1889, he became the fourth president of the LDS Church. His detailed journals provide valuable insights into the history of the Latter-day Saints.

## Project Outline
Our goal for this project is to create pipelines that enable anyone to contribute insights by following the instructions provided on this page. We have already developed several projects, one of which is the Woodruff's Travel Timeline Map. This interactive map allows you to explore the places he visited throughout his lifetime. Additionally, we have a couple of ideas for other projects that we are considering:

- Discussions of Fishing
- His Proselytizing Missions
- Important People
- Church


## .github/workflows File
We will set use CI/CD (automation process) to automate the process.
